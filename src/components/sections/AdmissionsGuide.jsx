                  <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    To get a place on any university course, you're going to have to meet the entry requirements. These university entry requirements (sometimes referred to as UCAS entry requirements) are effectively a set of boxes that you need to be able to tick.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    If you meet the required level for each item on the list, you're in the running for a place on the course. Each university will set these entry requirements for each of its courses; the general idea being that they are set at a level where the university can then feel confident you'll be able to cope with the demands of the course.

                  <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    The entry requirements should be pretty much the first thing you look at when you're researching university courses. You need to meet these requirements in order to get a place on the course, so there's not much point focusing on courses where the requirements are out of reach.

                        What grades have you got? What grades are you expecting? Universities will look at what you've been studying since your GCSEs (or equivalent), as this is going to be the most recent evidence of your academic performance before starting university.

                      <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">
                        Grades will be the main thing here - either grades you have already achieved or those that your teachers or tutors have predicted for you. But it's not just grades that matter.

                        Some universities measure academic performance in terms of UCAS points rather than grades. These points are a way for university staff to measure scores and grades across qualifications. Every grade for every included qualification is worth a set number of points; higher grades get higher amounts of points.

                        It's common for GCSEs in English and maths to be asked for as part of a university's entry requirements. Most universities will look for at least a 4 (sometimes a 5) at GCSE in these subjects. Specific courses may also ask for minimum grades in certain relevant GCSE subjects.

                        For more selective universities and competitive courses, you might be asked to sit a special exam to help admissions staff find the strongest candidates. If you're applying to Oxbridge or want to study a subject like law or medicine, this will likely apply to you.

                        A few universities – including Oxford, Cambridge and Imperial College London – interview most or all of their applicants. Where a course receives a high number of eligible applicants, admissions tutors may ask you for an interview either online or in person.

                        If you're applying to a performing arts course like drama or music, you'll almost certainly need to audition once the university has considered your application. The university will provide guidance on your audition piece and key things you should demonstrate on the day.

The university will tell you whether you need to submit this online, deliver it in person or present it to a tutor.

                        Offered by universities to help students fill in any gaps in their knowledge, so they can progress on to a full degree course. They might be a good option if you're not sure you want to commit to a particular subject for three years.

                    <li>• Check entry requirements early - they should be the first thing you look at</li>
                    <li>• Don't only apply to courses with requirements you've already met - aim slightly higher if you feel confident</li>
                    <li>• Universities can be flexible - if you just miss the grades, it's worth getting in touch</li>
                    <li>• Strong personal statements can make a difference for borderline cases</li>
                    <li>• Entry requirements can change, so always double-check on the university's official website</li>
