                  <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    To get a place on any university course, you're going to have to meet the entry requirements. These university entry requirements (sometimes referred to as UCAS entry requirements) are effectively a set of boxes that you need to be able to tick.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    If you meet the required level for each item on the list, you're in the running for a place on the course. Each university will set these entry requirements for each of its courses; the general idea being that they are set at a level where the university can then feel confident you'll be able to cope with the demands of the course.

                    The entry requirements should be pretty much the first thing you look at when you're researching university courses. You need to meet these requirements in order to get a place on the course, so there's not much point focusing on courses where the requirements are out of reach.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-gray-700">
                    With thousands of courses to choose from, you can use entry requirements to quickly prioritise possible UCAS choices to research in more detail.

                        Some universities measure academic performance in terms of UCAS points rather than grades. These points are a way for university staff to measure scores and grades across qualifications. Every grade for every included qualification is worth a set number of points; higher grades get higher amounts of points.

                        It's common for GCSEs in English and maths to be asked for as part of a university's entry requirements. Most universities will look for at least a 4 (sometimes a 5) at GCSE in these subjects. Specific courses may also ask for minimum grades in certain relevant GCSE subjects.

                        For more selective universities and competitive courses, you might be asked to sit a special exam to help admissions staff find the strongest candidates. If you're applying to Oxbridge or want to study a subject like law or medicine, this will likely apply to you.

                    <li>‚Ä¢ Check entry requirements early - they should be the first thing you look at</li>
                    <li>‚Ä¢ Don't only apply to courses with requirements you've already met - aim slightly higher if you feel confident</li>
                    <li>‚Ä¢ Universities can be flexible - if you just miss the grades, it's worth getting in touch</li>
                    <li>‚Ä¢ Strong personal statements can make a difference for borderline cases</li>
                    <li>‚Ä¢ Entry requirements can change, so always double-check on the university's official website</li>
